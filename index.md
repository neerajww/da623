## Course Contents
The course content will be partitioned into four parts - 3 parts on teaching, 1 part on development and research.

**Part-1**: Foundations of Signal Processing

1. Introduction to signals: sensory signals, atmospheric signals, and chemical signals, etc.
2. Sensory processing: Hearing, vision, and our brain
3. Signal representations: continuous, Fourier series, Taylor series, discrete-time, sampling, basis functions, and linear algebra fundamentals
4. DSP Methods: LTI system, convolution, DFT, DCT, time-frequency analysis

**Part-2**: Advance Signal Processing

1. Compressive Sensing, Dictionary Learning
2. Dimensionality Reduction: Concept and approaches
3. Spectral Estimation, Filtering, artifacts, and Kalman Filtering

**Part-3**: Machine Learning on Signals

1. What is a model? Why use a model? What are types of models?
2. Model fitting (or estimation) using deterministics and probabilistic approaches
4. Classifiers: Logistics regressions to DNNs

**Part-4**: Hands-on Development & Research
1. Project: Pursued by students - Runs through out the course - Topics: Theory and Applications of SP and ML
2. Paper: Pursued by students - Paper Reading and Understanding - Critiquing through Presentation
