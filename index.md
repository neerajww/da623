## Course Contents

**Part-1**: Foundations of Deep learning (Implementing and training different types of neural networks )

1. Starting from an artificial neuron we aim to understand feed forward and recurrent architectures of Artificial Neural Networks. We visit Neurons (MP, perceptron), MLP, CNNs, and RNNs (LSTM and GRU). We will understand how to train these models (via the Gradient Descent technique using the Backpropagation algorithm).
2. Realizing these architectures in the PyTorch framework. We understand the underlying computational graph, Autograd function, batch processing of the data, etc. culminating into writing PyTorch modules. 

**Part-2**: Applications in Computer Vision (with a research flavour)

1. Object recognition, detection, semantic segmentation
2. Vision and Language
3. Generative models: GANs and VAEs 
4. Recent trends (Attention, Transformers, learning with limited supervision, etc.)
